        Welcome to the “Hiding” game experiment! Before we start, please respond to the informed consent form.

        <b>Informed consent form</b><br/>

        A. Project Description<br/>
        The game involves a set of boxes and a number of objects to be hidden in the boxes.
        Each box has a value by which the number of objects in the box is multiplied (the box’ <b>multiplication rate</b>).<br/>
        You will play either as a “Hider” or as an “Opener”. If you are a Hider you will distribute the
        objects endowed to you across the boxes; if you are an Opener you will choose half of the boxes to be opened later.<br/>
        The Opener earns the value of the objects in the opened boxes, the Hider earns the value of the objects in the remaining boxes.<br/>
        After playing, you will be asked to answer few questions.
